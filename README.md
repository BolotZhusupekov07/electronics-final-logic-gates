## We created logic gates simulator.

## This is the one theme of electronic's lesson
### A logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output. 
### In our project simulator we added not bad skins and design.
### In logic gates we have symbols. When a transistor is on, or open, then an electric current can flow through. And when it's off, then no current flows. When you string a bunch of these transistors together, then you get what's called a logic gate, which lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide binary numbers in any way imaginable.
